Previously, you created a two-player math game. Each player had certain characteristics, and the game had certain rules that you had to build the logic to accomplish.

Now, you are going to rebuild your game using OOP principles.

## Git branching
Make a new branch of your repository in Git, name it whatever you want. (Ex: twoop) Do all of your OOP development for this exercise there.

## Player Class
You will have a Player class, where you will put all of your Player-specific logic and properties.

Your program will still have to keep track of whose turn it is, and check players' scores and lives.

## Methods
Your Player class should have instance methods for the following tasks:

gain a point
lose a life

## TIPS!
You can use attr_accessor for things like Player names.

Continue to use the enhancements from the previous exercise. If you didn't get a chance to code them then, do so now. This includes Better Math, and Colourization.
